  /**
   * Returns a timed and authenticated URL to get an object. This is the equivalent
   * to AWS S3’s “presigned” URL. Please note that Telnyx performs authentication
   * differently from AWS S3 and you MUST NOT use the presign method of AWS s3api CLI
   * or sdk to generate the presigned URL.
   *
   * Refer to: https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/cloud-storage/presigned-urls
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const response =
   *   await client.storage.buckets.createPresignedURL('', {
   *     bucketName: '',
